--- Day 11: Cosmic Expansion ---
--- Part One ---

The researcher has collected a bunch of data and compiled the data
into a single giant image (your puzzle input). The image includes
empty space (.) and galaxies (#).

The researcher is trying to figure out the sum of the lengths of the
shortest path between every pair of galaxies. However, there's a
catch: the universe expanded in the time it took the light from those
galaxies to reach the observatory.

Due to something involving gravitational effects, only some space
expands. In fact, the result is that any rows or columns that contain
no galaxies should all actually be twice as big.

Expand the universe, then find the length of the shortest path between
every pair of galaxies. What is the sum of these lengths?

LEO'S NOTES:

OK two parts to this:

1. Expand the universe. Might be easier to ingest the data as a list
of rows at first, just to make the expansion easier. Then turn it into
a 2D array for part 2.

Take two: now that I've seen part two I'm going to refactor
this. Instead of manually expanding the universe I'm going to just
keep track of the rows and cols that are expanded - I'll call these
WORMHOLES. So now:

1. Collect the galaxy points

2. Collect the wormhole rows and cols

3. Sum the Manhattan distance between all the galaxies. Adding
WORMHOLE-SIZE for every time the route crosses a wormhole.

Seems simple enough. And if it works in part one (which I've already
solved by expanding the universe) it will work in part two!

Except it didn't. The refactored code worked with part one but not
with the provided tests for part two. Hmmm. Why would it work with a
wormhole size of 1 but not 10 or 100? OH! The manhattan distance
already includes the first step into the wormhole! So I'll reduce the
wormhole size by one (for everything except the wormhole size of 1)
and bingo!

The universe is represented in three ways depending on the operation
a list of strings LOS (as provided by the problem set), a list of
lists of characters UNI (needed to rotate the universe), and finally
UNIVERSE a 2D array for the manhattan distances.

--- Part Two ---

Now, instead of the expansion you did before, make each empty row or
column one million times larger. That is, each empty row should be
replaced with 1000000 empty rows, and each empty column should be
replaced with 1000000 empty columns.

LEO'S NOTES:

Uh oh. I'm going to need a way to simplify this. My part 1 solution
clearly won't do. The problem is not figuring the distances - that's
simple aritimetic - it's expanding the universe. There's not enough
memory for an array that big.

So maybe instead of literally expanding the universe, I somehow keep
track of where the expansions are and add that many millions to the
manhattan-distance. Hmmm.

1. Make a list of galaxy locations
2. Make a list of wormhole locations (maybe just rows and cols)
3. Get manhattan distance between galaxies
4. Add a million for every time the path crosses a wormhole
5. Profit!

But wait - I could have done this in part 1. Worth refactoring? Yeah,
and it works when the wormhole size is 1 but it's too high
otherwise. Sounds like the wormholes mess up the "shortest distance" -
is it not always the manhattan distance?
