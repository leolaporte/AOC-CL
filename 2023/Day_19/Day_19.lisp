"Sort through all of the parts you've been given; what do you get if
you add together all of the rating numbers for all of the parts that
ultimately get accepted?"

LEO'S NOTES: Looks like an immutable hash-table for the
instructions. They never change. The name of the rule is the hash key,
the instructions maybe represented as a function? Output of the
function is either 1. another key 2. rejected 3. accepted.

All parts start at key IN.

So can px=> a<2006:qkq,m>2090:A,rfg be represented as a function?
px =>
(lambda (x)
(cond ((< (first x) 2600) qkq)
((> (second x) 2090) A)
(t rfg)))

(funcall (gethash px workflows) x) ; where x is a list of x m a s

If any chain of funcalls returns A then add (+ x m a s) to total.

Ultimately it's just a problem of parsing. Let's go.

--- Part Two ---

"Each of the four ratings (x, m, a, s) can have an integer value
ranging from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 4000. Of all possible
distinct combinations of ratings, your job is to figure out which ones
will be accepted.  How many distinct combinations of ratings will be
accepted by the Elves' workflows?"

Ugh. So we have to whittle 4000^4 (256 trillion) possibilities to
what? a solution that's somewhat lower. But how do we whittle?

In effect I'll start a list of RANGES (0-4000 0-4000 0-4000 0-4000)
through the TESTs, starting at IN. When I reach {s<1351:px,qqz}, for
example, I'll split the RANGES into two: (0-4000 0-4000 0-4000 0-1350)
which goes to PX and (0-4000 0-4000 0-4000 1351-4000) which goes to
QQZ. At QQZ, {s>2770:qs,m<1801:hdj,R}, there will be multiple
splits. (0-4000 1801-4000 0-4000 0-1350) will go to R and I can
discard it. That leaves (0-4000 0-4000 0-4000 1351-4000) which will
split into (0-4000 0-4000 0-4000 1351-2770) which will become (0-4000
0-1800 0-4000 1351-2770) which will go to HDJ and (0-4000 0-4000
0-4000 2771-4000) which goes to QS, etc etc. At the end of this
process I will have some ranges in the A bucket which I can tally for
the answer.

Maybe a better metaphor is a Tunnel of Love. I'm sending a little BOAT
down the TUNNEL where it will enter a successive series of TRANSITs
to face a list of TESTs. Each test will whittle the number of
possibilities down and/or shunt the boat to a new TRANSIT. The boat
may split into multiple boats at each TRANSIT. At the end, each of
the multitude of boats will reach one of two docks, either R, to be
ignored, or A where all the ranges will be tallied up to provide the
problem's answer.

So the first issue is to think about how I represent the tunnel,
tests, and boats.

TUNNEL will be a hash-table of TRANSITs. Each TRANSIT will have a
name (e.g. "in", "qx", "qrs") and a list of TESTs to be performed on
the BOAT.

TEST will be a structure encapsulating the information provided by the
workflows: the category (or SEAT) affected, the operation (or
SPLITTER) to be performed, and the RANGE split. Each test will also
have a SHUNT which is where the subject BOAT will go next.

BOATs will have four SEATs, each reflecting a range of numbers from
START to END. Each boat will also have a NEXT slot reflecting the next
TRANSIT (or R and A docks) that it is being sent to.
