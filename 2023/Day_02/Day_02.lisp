--- Day 2: Cube Conundrum ---
--- Part One ---

Each time you play this game, he will hide a secret number of cubes of
each color in the bag, and your goal is to figure out information
about the number of cubes.

To get information, once a bag has been loaded with cubes, the Elf
will reach into the bag, grab a handful of random cubes, show them to
you, and then put them back in the bag. He'll do this a few times per
game.

You play several games and record the information from each game (your
puzzle input). Each game is listed with its ID number (like the 11 in
Game 11: ...)  followed by a semicolon-separated list of subsets of
cubes that were revealed from the bag (like 3 red, 5 green, 4 blue).

Determine which games would have been possible if the bag had been
loaded with only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes. What
is the sum of the IDs of those games?

NOTE: The order of the colors is random.  We'll need a test -
possible? - that determines if a game is possible given the
parameters. Better yet, possible should return the game number if
possible, 0 if not.

It's impossible if: the number of cubes of a given color is higher
than the max.

So it's sufficient to find the highest number seen of each color in a
game. Then compare that number to the max for the possible? test.

--- Part Two ---

As you continue your walk, the Elf poses a second question: in each
game you played, what is the fewest number of cubes of each color that
could have been in the bag to make the game possible?

The power of a set of cubes is equal to the numbers of red, green, and
blue cubes multiplied together.

NOTE: This should be easy using the parse-game function. The second,
third, and fourth items in the list returned are the max number of red
green and blue cubes. Walk the list, multiplying those three values
together and adding the result.
