--- Day 13: Point of Incidence ---
--- Part One ---

"To find the reflection in each pattern, you need to find a perfect
reflection across either a horizontal line between two rows or across
a vertical line between two columns.

To summarize your pattern notes, add up the number of columns to the
left of each vertical line of reflection; to that, also add 100
multiplied by the number of rows above each horizontal line of
reflection."

LEO'S NOTES: Well the first thing I noticed is that UNLIKE the example
data, the actual data features rectangles of VARYING sizes. I'll have
to deal with each rectangle individually.

For each rectangle search for duplicated rows, if no rows, then
columns. Then count the rows to the left or above (1- mirror row/cols
in other words). For now each rect will be a list of equal length
strings.

Wait. This is more complicated than finding duplicate rows. I have to
find entire duplicated SIDES. It has to be able to fold at the row or
col and match up.

So, for example, if we think rows 2-3 in the first rect are the fold
line, we have to make sure that 1-4 and 0-5 are also dupes. 0-5 do NOT
match, so it's not a fold line.

So...

1. search for duplicate side-by-side rows (I'll call them fold
candidates).

2. when I have one check the rows on either side. If match, continue
until either there's no match, or I reach the edge on either side. If
I reach the edge then candidate-fold is actual-fold and I return the
index of the first fold row +1 (the rows are zero-based).

3. If rows don't match, do the same with cols (rotate rect and repeat)

FIXES: OK sneaky. I've found at least one rectangle with three folds -
only ; one is a mirror so I have to keep checking for multiple folds
in any given rectangle.

Oh and also apparently some people had NO mirrors in one or more rects
- in which case the result is 0. Which of course doesn't affect the
result - but it shouldn't cause an error by comparing nil to 0. So
I'll fix that.

--- Part Two ---

"Upon closer inspection, you discover that every mirror has exactly
one smudge: exactly one . or # should be the opposite type.

In each pattern, you'll need to locate and fix the smudge that causes
a _different reflection line to be valid_. (The old reflection line
won't necessarily continue being valid after the smudge is fixed.)

In each pattern, fix the smudge and find the different line of
reflection. What number do you get after summarizing the new
reflection line in each pattern in your notes?"

LEO'S NOTES:

Well it doesn't look like there are any hints as to where that smudge
may be. So what's the best way to find it?

The smudge can be anywhere on a mirror. So I need to test for off by
one mirror lines. It's really not so different from part 1 - I just
have to relax the rules a bit for finding possible fold lines.

Refactoring part 1 so I can use a looser string compare function. And
creating a new off-by-exactly-one string compare.

The trick here is that the relaxed string compare can only be used
once in any given rectangle. So I need a closure that keeps track of
the state of the compare - once relaxed compare has been used it must
revert to an exact compare until the next rectangle.

FIXES: Hmm. The number is too high. I guess I really will have to
eliminate mirrors from part 1. (Remember that line: 'fix the smudge
that causes a DIFFERENT reflection line to be valid'?) Drat.

It's getting ugly up there. Instead of continuing to Frankenstein my
solution from Part 1 I'm going to leave it as is and create new
definitions for part 2 below.
