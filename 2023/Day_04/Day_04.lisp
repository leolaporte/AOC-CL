--- Day 4: Scratchcards ---
--- Part One ---

"Each card has two lists of numbers separated by a vertical bar (|): a list of
winning numbers and then a list of numbers you have. You organize the
information into a table (your puzzle input).

As far as the Elf has been able to figure out, you have to figure out which of
the numbers you have appear in the list of winning numbers. The first match
makes the card worth one point and each match after the first doubles the point
value of that card.

Take a seat in the large pile of colorful cards. How many points are they worth
in total?"

Note: Uh this seems pretty easy - way too easy. I can do this a line at a time,
each line is standalone.

1. Import the line into two lists WINNERS and HAND.

2. For every number in HAND if it's a member of WINNERS add points

3. The point score is 1 for the first match and the score doubles after each
subsecquent match.

For the THIRD day in a row the test passes but not the final
result. Hmmm. What's the edgecase not represented in the test data? Duh. I
assumed the length of every hand was the same as in the test data. Re-wrote the
scanner to work with any size hand.

--- Part Two ---

There's no such thing as "points". Instead, scratchcards only cause you to win
more scratchcards equal to the number of winning numbers you have.

Specifically, you win copies of the scratchcards below the winning card equal to
the number of matches. So, if card 10 were to have 5 matching numbers, you would
win one copy each of cards 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.

Copies of scratchcards are scored like normal scratchcards and have the same
card number as the card they copied. So, if you win a copy of card 10 and it has
5 matching numbers, it would then win a copy of the same cards that the original
card 10 won: cards 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. This process repeats until none of
the copies cause you to win any more cards. (Cards will never make you copy a
card past the end of the table.)

Process all of the original and copied scratchcards until no more scratchcards
are won. Including the original set of scratchcards, how many total scratchcards
do you end up with?

NOTES:
Looks like I'm starting over. This time I need to parse each card into a record:
(defstruct card: number copies winners hand) As I pass through the list of
scratchcards I increment subsequent cards in the records to make copies. When I
get to a card I process it 'copies number of times. When I get to the end of the
list of scratchcard records I total all the COPIES for the answer.

It works but it's SLOW! Oh well. It works.
