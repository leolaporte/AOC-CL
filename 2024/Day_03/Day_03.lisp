--- Day 3: Mull It Over ---
--- Part One ---

"It seems like the goal of the program is just to multiply some numbers.
It does that with instructions like mul(X,Y), where X and Y are each
1-3 digit numbers.

However, because the program's memory has been corrupted, there are
also many invalid characters that should be ignored, even if they look
like part of a mul instruction. Sequences like mul(4*, mul(6,9!,
?(12,34), or mul ( 2 , 4 ) do nothing.

What do you get if you add up all of the results of the
multiplications?"

LEO NOTES: We streamed this one again at
https://youtube.com/@leolaporte - thanks to Paul Holder and Cyphase
who kibbitzed and provided some very valuable direction as I worked.

Looks like a regexp for mul(#,#) will do the job - seems pretty
straightforward. I did have to mess with the parsing of the input
which was provided as a list of five strings intended to be
interpreted as one. Using the regex modifier (?s) ignores the
newlines. So if I use (uiop:read-file-string) to read in the input
then parse it ignoring the newlines all should be well.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |#

(defparameter *example* "xmul(2,4)%&mul[3,7]!@^do_not_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64]then(mul(11,8)mul(8,5))")

(defparameter *valid* (re:create-scanner "(?s)mul\\(\\d+,\\d+\\)")) ; the regex

(defun extract-proper-instructions (str)
  "given a string with some proper instructions and some corrupt
instructions, return a list of all the proper instruction strings."
  (re:all-matches-as-strings *valid* str))

(defun execute-instruction (instr)
  "given an instruction string in the form mul(##,##), return the result
of multiplying the numbers"
  (apply #'*
         (mapcar #'parse-integer (re:all-matches-as-strings "\\d+" instr))))

(defun Day_03-1 (progstr)
  "given a string containing proper and improper instructions,
return the sum of the proper multiplcations in all the strings"
  (iter (for inst in (extract-proper-instructions progstr))
    (summing (execute-instruction inst))))

(5a:test Day_03-1-test
  (5a:is (= 161 (Day_03-1 *example*))))

#| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Part Two ---

"There are two new instructions you'll need to handle:

The do() instruction enables future mul instructions.  The don't()
instruction disables future mul instructions.  Only the most recent
do() or don't() instruction applies. At the beginning of the program,
mul instructions are enabled."

LEO's NOTES: Again with the regexp. This time I'll extract the chunks
with do() at the beginning and ending with don't() and ignore
everything else. Then do as I did in part one with those valid
chunks.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |#

(defparameter *example2*
  "xmul(2,4)&mul[3,7]!^don't()_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64](mul(11,8)undo()?mul(8,5))")

(defun extract-chunks (str)
  "given a string containing instructions including do() and don't(),
return a list of strings of instructions between do and don't
i.e. proper instructions"
  (re:all-matches-as-strings
   "(?s)do\\(\\)(.*?)don't\\(\\)" ; the regex
   (concatenate 'string "do()" str "don't()"))) ; put do and don't at ends

(defun Day_03-2 (progstr)
  (iter (for chunk in (extract-chunks progstr))
    (summing (Day_03-1 chunk))))

(5a:test Day_03-2-test
  (5a:is (= 48 (Day_03-2 *example2*))))
